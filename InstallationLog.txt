Trying to install ml-agents and pytorch with Python3.10.12 within WSL Ubuntu in order to train RL model within Unity

- Install git: sudo apt-get install git
- Follow these steps: https://tsdat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/setup_wsl/#using-a-wsl-environment-in-vscode to set up VS Code with WSL
- Then follow these: https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/release_21_docs/docs/Installation.md to set up ml-agents
=> Actually worked!!!

- Check WSL version in Windows Powershell: wsl -l -v
- Check WSL Kernel version in Windows Powershell: wsl cat /proc/version
# Or check both above with: wsl --version
# In case needed, run this to update: wsl --shutdown => wsl --update
# In case to revert to previous version: wsl --update --rollback
# Check GPU hardware type: sudo lshw -C display

- Install nvidia-driver for base WINDOWS system NOT IN WSL
- Run this to show monitoring snapshot: nvidia-smi
- Install CUDA Toolkit and strictly follow instruction for WSL Ubuntu on: https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/wsl-user-guide/index.html
- Remove old GPG key: sudo apt-key del 7fa2af80
# Especially this: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64&Distribution=WSL-Ubuntu&target_version=2.0&target_type=deb_local
# To install new key: sudo cp /var/cuda-repo-wsl-ubuntu-12-3-local/cuda-E7B9884F-keyring.gpg /usr/share/keyrings/
=> Basically, we want to install CUDA toolkit in WSL only, but not the driver bcs it will override the main system's driver which is Windows

- To train and observe Training over Tensorboard, follow instruction on this link: https://unity-technologies.github.io/ml-agents/Training-ML-Agents/
- Here we run inside the Hummingbird-training-folder: tensorboard --logdir results --port 6006
+ It triggered ImportError: no "pkg_resources" found / ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pkg_resources' when it tried to import pkg_resourses
- However everything else seemed to work fine.
